# VITBusTracker

The application uses Swift Mapkit and Firestore to accurately track University buses. The tracking application 
for the busses are made using an android application that will update the firestore each time there is significant
change in the busses location. The iOS application will get the location data from firestore "when there is a change" 
and update the location of the busses in Real-time. Students at VIT University are also allocated their bus own numbers.
The application can track all the buses that are present in the database.
